# Automated Lecture Transcription and Summarization System with Multilingual Support

## **Overview**
This project aims to develop an **AI-powered system** that transcribes lecture audio, generates concise summaries, and translates them into multiple languages. The system is designed to improve accessibility and help students and educators efficiently process lecture content.

## **Features**
âœ… **Speech-to-Text** â€“ Converts lecture audio into accurate text transcriptions.  
âœ… **Text Summarization** â€“ Extracts key points and generates a concise summary.  
âœ… **Multilingual Translation** â€“ Supports translation into multiple languages.  
âœ… **Modular Architecture** â€“ Easily scalable and adaptable for future enhancements.  
âœ… **Privacy Focused** â€“ Ensures data security and compliance with regulations.  

## **Technology Stack**
ðŸ”¹ **Speech-to-Text (ASR):** Whisper 
ðŸ”¹ **Summarization:** T5 
ðŸ”¹ **Translation:** Google Translate API

## **System Workflow**
1. **Audio Input:** Users upload lecture audio.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Background noise reduction and segmentation.  
3. **Speech-to-Text:** Audio is transcribed using state-of-the-art ASR models.  
4. **Summarization:** Key points are extracted to generate a concise summary.  
5. **Translation:** The summary is translated into multiple languages.  
6. **Output:** The transcript and summary are provided in text format.  


## **Future Enhancements**
ðŸ”¹ Real-time transcription and translation  
ðŸ”¹ Mobile app version  
ðŸ”¹ Support for additional languages  
ðŸ”¹ Enhanced AI model customization
